1. What is the complete role of the Transport Admin?
The Transport Admin manages one transport company’s day-to-day operations:
Create/edit routes (AM/PM/field trips), stops, timings.
Assign/replace drivers, aides, buses to routes.
Monitor live tracking, delays, incidents, and attendance.
Issue/activate/deactivate RFID cards.
Handle parent/school requests (absence, address change).
Open/track maintenance tickets; view fuel/health status.
Generate reports (attendance, on-time %, incidents).
Manage company-level users (drivers/aides/site managers/mechanics).
Scope limit: Transport Admin sees only their own company’s data. No cross-company access.

2. How does a Transport Admin differ from a Site Manager?
Transport Admin = company-level control (all depots, all routes).
Site Manager = depot/yard-level ops (just their location).
3. Site Manager responsibilities (detailed)
Daily roll-out: confirm drivers/aides present (RFID/face ID), confirm buses “ready”.
Yard control: parking layout, bus warm-up, fuel check, cleanliness status.
Pre-trip inspections: run checklist; flag defects for mechanics.
Go/No-Go decisions per route; escalate replacements to Transport Admin.
Issue reporting: create maintenance tickets; track status.
Arrival control: confirm returns, note defects/fuel for next shift.
Site Manager does NOT create new schools/companies or billing; they operate within the company defined by the Transport Admin.
4. Who handles transport companies—Transport Admin or Super Admin?
Super Admin (our platform owner) manages companies (create, suspend, plan).
Transport Admin is assigned to one company after Super Admin creates it.
5. Can a Transport Admin register a company?
No (for MVP). Only Super Admin can create/register companies and assign Transport Admins.
Reason: keeps billing/compliance centralized and avoids scope creep.
6. What about subscriptions?
We will support subscriptions, but to avoid extra cost right now, MVP uses:
Manual activation by Super Admin (plan, start/end date, status).
We can record invoices manually (amount, due date, paid/unpaid) without a gateway.
Plans are metadata only (Basic/Team/Company/Enterprise) controlling feature flags.
Stripe (or Paddle) integration is a Phase-2 enhancement, not included in the current budget/timeline.
7. If Stripe is required now, is there extra charge?
we will NOT integrate Stripe in MVP.
Deliverables remain within 2–3 months without Stripe: manual subscription control by Super Admin. Since us product owners will give access to at least 1 company for testing and developing we need to charge them based on subscription so don’t worry I will be handling that manually but later we have to have subscriptions control
